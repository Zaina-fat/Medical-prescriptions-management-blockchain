# Medical Prescriptions Management using Blockchain

Every pharmaceutical medicine that is legally required to be purchased with a medical prescription can still be purchased with a handwritten prescription. This creates an issue with authenticity. Furthermore, it is sadly widespread practice for a pharmacist not to request to see the medical prescription, even when it is required. These activities definitely constitute a significant risk of drug use disorders and over medication in the general population. This project aims to find a solution to these problems. 

Our solution comprises of a blockchain application that authenticates medical prescriptions and allows information transfer between medical practitioners, pharmacies, and authorities, resulting in the creation of a safe prescriptions database. Prescriptions transferred via the blockchain network, as well as the identities of the medical doctor and the patient, may be validated. Pharmacists would then be able to authenticate the prescription's legitimacy, ensuring that they are selling a drug for lawful usage.
